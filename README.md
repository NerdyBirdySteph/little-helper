# Little Helper
A personal assistant that helps you remember things and people.

This is a project made for getting to know and experimenting  with React, [brixo-framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brixo-framework), [brixo-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brixo-ui) and [fluxo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluxo).

After cloning the project run `npm install` to install dependencies, and finally run `grunt config` which will guide you through setting up required configuration-files such as Firebase.
